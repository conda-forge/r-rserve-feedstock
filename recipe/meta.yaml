  summary: Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets)  which allows binary requests
    to be sent to R. Every connection has a separate workspace and working directory.
    Client-side implementations are available for popular languages such as C/C++ and
    Java, allowing any application to use facilities of R without the need of linking
    to R code. Rserve supports remote connection, user authentication and file transfer.
    A simple R client is included in this package as well.
